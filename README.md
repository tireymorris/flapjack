# hyperwave

hyperwave combines the benefits of traditional server-rendered applications with the flexibility of modern client-side frameworks.

- **Performance:** Server-side rendering ensures fast, responsive applications, tailored to produce the smallest possible bundles.
- **Developer experience:** HTMX and Tailwind provide a minimalistic and declarative approach to building user interfaces
- **Deployment:** bun applications can be easily deployed on any platform as portable binaries
